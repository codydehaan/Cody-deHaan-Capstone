# Red Light, Green Light - Spacebar Sprint

<img src="Images/RLGL.gif" alt="Gameplay Demo" width="300">

**A simple Pygame-based, 2D, road scrolling game. The user controls the car with the spacebar, driving down a never ending road. If the user moves while the light is red, the game ends. The game focuses on testing the users reflexes.**

**How far can you make it?**

# Key Features

- **Instructions & countdown**: Displays centered instructions and gives the user a countdown.

- **Traffic Lights**: Random durations each time the light changes from green to yellow to red.

- **Scrolling Background**: The road scrolls in the background. Giving the illusion of movement.

- **Car Animation**: The car subtly bounces using simple trigonometry to enhance realism.

- **Miles Driven**: Tracks the distance the car drives in miles, based off of pixel movement.

- **Game Over Condition**: Game triggers a game over message if the car moves during red.

- **Restarting Condition**: This feature allows the user to restart the game after a loss.

- **High Score**: Records the longest distance achieved during the current play session.
