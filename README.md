# Red Light, Green Light - Home From Work

**A simple Pygame-based, 2D, road scrolling game. The user controls a car driving home from work. If the user moves on a red light the game will end. The game focuses on testing the users reflexes until the "Miles to home:" counter reaches 0.**

# Key Features

- Instructions & countdown: Displays the centered instructions and gives the user a countdown.

- Traffic Lights: Random durations each time the light changes from green to yellow to red.

- Scrolling Background: The road scrolls in the background. Giving the illusion of movement.

- Car Animation: The car bounces up and down using a simple trigonometry equation. Furthering the illusion of movement.

- Restarting Condition: This feature allows the user to restart the game after each loss.
